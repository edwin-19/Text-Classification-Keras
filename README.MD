# Text Classification
The purpose of this repo was to test out basic layers such as lstm and text vectorization layers

# TODO
- [x] text vectorization layer
- [x] lstm model
- [ ] Check overfit reason
- [x] Write a simple tensorflow dense layer using simple classifier
- [x] Wrote for multi class problem, added return sequence for lstm
